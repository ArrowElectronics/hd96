HelmsDeep96 - Trusted Platfrom
====================================================

Story
------------------------
The “HelmsDeep96” Board based on Microchip silicon, comes available, through Arrow’s Provisioning Services, preloaded with the EmSPARK Security Suite by Sequitur Labs. The security suite provides a secure platform applicable across all IoT verticals to enable secure devices and protect firmware, keys and data throughout the lifecycle of a product. EmSPARK is the essential software companion suite complementing the Microchip hardware providing a cost-effective solution appropriate for every connected device built with the ATSAMA5D2 processor. Engineers can leverage this solution for the rapid prototyping of digital transformation built on trust extracting the full value of the advanced embedded security features of the ATSAMA5D2 MPU. Out of the box the firmware implements a secure boot chain from ROM to the Linux kernel, diversified devices and a secure enclave using TrustZone/TEE abstracted through an easy to use SDK. 

HelmsDeep96 is compliant to 96Boards IoT Edition, the only SoC independent open platform specifications. It supports secure firmware updates, secure storage, secure element, tamper detection, key and certificate management, crypto engine and an OpenSSL adaptor. The HelmsDeep96 offers a single place for both hardware and software for product security development needs.
